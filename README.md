# vim
My VIM setup

I'm new to VIM and to Github so this should be an adventure.  Hopefully it won't be a train wreck.

My primary interest in in javascript (Node, Angular, HTML, css).

Notes:
--------
Clone into ~/.vim
cd ~/.vim
cp ~/vimrc ~/.vimrc


NERDTree
Load vim, run
:helptags ~/.vim/bundle/nerdtree/doc/
:help NERD_Tree.txt
